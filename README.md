# Arcade Library - City of Dublin, Ohio
This respository organizes examples of arcade expressions based on their function and language features. We use this repo internally to gather and organize examples of arcade script within our projects. It is our hope that this tool will create a more streamlined way of learning, utilizing, and ~stealing~ repurposing arcade script. 
## Organization
Files/script examples should be organized into folders based on their function/language feature. For example, intersect functions examples should be included in the intersects folder.
