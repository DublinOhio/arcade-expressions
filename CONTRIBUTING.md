# How to Contribute
Thank you for contributing to our growing library of arcade expressions for GIS users and developers in local government!
Here are some important resources:
- [City of Dublin, Ohio](https://dublinohiousa.gov/city-profile/) tells you more about who we are.
- [ArcGIS Arcade Library](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/) gives you an overview of arcade. 
- [ArcGIS Arcade Function Reference](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/function-reference/geometry_functions/) provides general examples of Arcade functions. 
  - ***Our organizational sysem closely follows the structure of this resource. When contributing, we ask that you follow this structure.*** 

### Submitting changes
Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated. When adding a new file of arcade script, we recommend including a few notes describing what your script accomplishes. 

If you wish to add a file/make a change, the best practice is to create changes in a branch and submit a pull request. This lets you discuss and review potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before making changes to the main branch. However, as administrators through DublinOhio, you will have permission to directly commit changes to the main branch without submitting a pull request. 

**Make Changes:** 

1. Fork the Project (if outside the City of Dublin)
2. Create your Feature Branch (git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature)
3. Commit your Changes (git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature')
4. Push to the Branch (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature)
5. Open a Pull Request
6. (Administrator) Merge pull request (accept changes)

To learn more about pull requests please click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). 
The purpose of this project is to organize a library of arcade expressions. Read more about coding conventions within arcade [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/guide/statements/).

## Adding Files and Folders
You cannot create an empty folder and then add files to that folder, but rather creation of a folder must happen together with adding of at least a single file. This is because git doesn't track empty folders.

On GitHub you can do it this way:

Go to the folder inside which you want to create another folder
Click on `New file`
On the text field for the file name, first write the folder name you want to create
Then type /. This creates a folder
You can add more folders similarly
Finally, give the new file a name (for example, `.gitkeep` which is conventionally used to make Git track otherwise empty folders; it is not a Git feature though)
Finally, click `Commit new file`.

## Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax
GitHub uses a version of markdown for its text formatting. Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML). 
[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#styling-text) provides a helpful guide for text editing in GitHub.
